# React + Vite

some instructions here!
since I used some other stuff, make sure you install these:
- npm install framer-motion
- npm install react-typed
- npm install react-burger-menu
- npm install tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest --save
If I happen to forget anything else...I'm sorry
but I'm 99% sure those are the only ones I used other than the other basic ones

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
